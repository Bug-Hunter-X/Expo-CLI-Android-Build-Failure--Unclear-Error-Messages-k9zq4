This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is usually vague and doesn't provide much information about the root cause.  It may manifest as a general build failure or a specific error related to a particular dependency or process.  One common symptom is a build process that hangs indefinitely without any clear indication of progress or failure.
