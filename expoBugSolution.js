Debugging this type of error often requires careful examination of the build logs (often quite lengthy). Look for hints in the output about specific failed processes or dependency issues. Strategies to resolve this include:

1. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuild. This removes any cached build artifacts that might be corrupted.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies in your `package.json` are compatible with Expo and the Android build system.  Update packages or check for known conflicts.
3. **Check Android SDK and Tools:** Verify that your Android SDK and build tools are properly installed and configured.  Updates might be necessary.
4. **Simplify the Project:** Create a minimal reproducible example.  Isolate the components of your app that may be causing the problem. If the error disappears in the simplified version, you've narrowed down the source.
5. **Examine Full Log Output:** Carefully inspect the complete logs for hints. Expo CLI sometimes produces warnings or other less prominent messages that might indicate problems.
